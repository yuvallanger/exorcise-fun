# Exorcise Fun - Remove cutesy foul symbols from your commandline tools

Is your bitter old blackened lump of coal of an heart cannot stand seeing all these festive symbols? Those cakes? Those party poppers? People smiling and having a good time? Are suffering from excessive eye rolling? Do your office mates suffer from your constant groaning?

Behold! The tool for you!

It will filter out all so called emojis and leave your terminal a colourless dark and dead place, just like you like it.
